    "\n",
    "Please write a program that performs polynomial simplification and polynomial multiplication. A polynomial is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(x)=a_n x^n+⋯+a_1 x+a_0$\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, consider the coefficients $a_0$ as integers and the power $n \\ge 0$. Use a dictionary to represent a polynomial that only saves non-zero terms. The first line of input will be several (power, coefficient) pairs, which represent the non-zero terms of $P_1 (x)$, and the second line represents $P_2 (x)$. Note that input may not be the polynomial after simplifying; that is, the same power may occur more than once, and you should sum them all. Please output the non-zero terms of $P_1 (x)$, $P_2 (x)$ and the result of $P_1 (x)×P_2 (x)$ in dictionary form. If the polynomial is a zero-polynomial, please output 0 directly.\n",
