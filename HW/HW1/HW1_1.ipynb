    "Consider the grade records containing five exams for class 01 and class 02, where class 01 has n students and class 02 has m students. Prompt the online judge for a string containing the random seed, the number of students in class01 (n), and the number of students in class02 (m). Create an array of n by 5 for class 01 and an array of m by 5 for class 02 with randomly generated grades between 40 – 100 (100 included). Output the mean and standard deviation with two decimal places for class01 and class02. Output the mean and standard deviation with two decimal places of each exam for all students.\n",
